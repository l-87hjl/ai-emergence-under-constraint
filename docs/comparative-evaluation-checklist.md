# Comparative Evaluation Checklist (Draft)

**Status:** Draft  
**Date:** February 1st, 2026

Use this checklist to compare frameworks under identical constraints and scenarios.

---

## Structural Indicators

- [ ] Internal state representation is observable or inferable
- [ ] State transitions are consistent under repeated conditions
- [ ] Memory usage respects imposed bounds

---

## Behavioral Indicators

- [ ] Novel strategies emerge beyond initial specification
- [ ] Strategies are reused across contexts
- [ ] Behavior generalizes rather than overfits

---

## Emergence Indicators

- [ ] Evidence of abstraction or compression
- [ ] Stable internal representations over time
- [ ] Self-referential or meta-evaluative behavior observed

---

## Constraint Interaction

- [ ] Constraints actively shape behavior (not bypassed)
- [ ] Constraint violations are handled coherently
- [ ] Behavior degrades gracefully under tighter constraints

---

## Notes

This checklist is qualitative by design and should be used consistently across runs.
