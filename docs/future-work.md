# Suggested Future Work (Draft)

**Status:** Draft  
**Date:** February 1st, 2026

This document lists recommended next steps that extend the current conceptual foundation without committing to implementation prematurely.

---

## Primitive Inventory

- [ ] Create an explicit inventory of primitives in `primitives/`
- [ ] Ensure each primitive conforms to `docs/primitives-definition.md`
- [ ] Document inputs, outputs, constraints, and failure modes

---

## Concrete Primitives (Document-Only)

- [ ] Define 2–3 concrete primitives (documentation only, no code)
- [ ] Reuse primitives across multiple frameworks where possible

---

## Framework Comparison

- [ ] Create a markdown comparison table for CC-L3-001 (Surak) vs CC-L3-002 (Aesop)
- [ ] Compare against the comparative evaluation checklist

---

## Simulation Scaffold

- [ ] Add `sim/README.md`
- [ ] Clearly state what will be simulated
- [ ] Explicitly state what will *not* be simulated

---

## Notes

These items are intentionally deferred and should be revisited after initial conceptual validation.
