# Emergence — Preliminary Definition (Draft)

**Status:** Draft  
**Date:** February 1st, 2026

## Working Definition

In this project, **emergence** refers to the appearance of qualitatively novel behaviors, representations, or internal structures that are **not explicitly specified** in the system’s base rules, but arise through interaction, iteration, and constraint.

Emergence is evaluated relative to:
- the system’s initial specification
- the imposed constraints
- the observer’s available explanatory model

---

## What Counts as Emergence

Indicators of emergence may include (but are not limited to):

- Formation of internal representations not directly encoded
- Strategy development beyond scripted or enumerated behaviors
- Compression or abstraction across time, state, or goals
- Self-referential evaluation or internal modeling
- Stable behavioral patterns that generalize across contexts

No single indicator is sufficient on its own.

---

## What Does NOT Count as Emergence

The following are explicitly excluded:

- Pre-programmed branching or lookup behavior
- Scale-up effects without qualitative novelty
- Randomness or noise mistaken for structure
- Output diversity without internal change
- Observer surprise alone

Complexity without novelty is not emergence.

---

## Degrees of Emergence (Provisional)

Emergence is treated as **graded**, not binary:

- **Weak emergence:** unexpected but shallow novelty
- **Moderate emergence:** stable novel strategies or representations
- **Strong emergence:** new abstractions, internal models, or meta-behaviors

These categories are provisional and may be refined.

## Notes

This definition is intentionally conservative and subject to revision based on experimental findings.
