**Status:** Draft  
**Date:** February 1st, 2026

This document captures distilled insights extracted from external interpretations of Covenant-related systems.

## Key Insights

- **Governance constrains actuation, not cognition.**  
  Reasoning quality is secondary to control over where reasoning can touch reality.

- **Alignment assumes intent; governance assumes fallibility.**  
  Covenant-style systems remain safe even when actors pursue misaligned goals.

- **Power must be mediated structurally.**  
  Legitimacy is enforced by design constraints, not trust or incentives.

- **Governors sit at the boundary of irreversibility.**  
  The most critical control point is the transition from intent to world-state change.
