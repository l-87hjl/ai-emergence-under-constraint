# Documentation Audit (Draft)

**Status:** Draft  
**Date:** February 1st, 2026

This document lists concepts, assumptions, and structural elements that currently exist implicitly or as stubs and require documentation.

---

## Undocumented or Partially Documented Concepts

- **Constraint** — Used broadly; types (hard vs soft, normative vs structural) not yet formalized
- **Framework** — Assumed meaning; lifecycle and required components not fully specified
- **Primitive** — Referenced in repo map; no canonical definition yet
- **Evaluation Loop** — Appears in scenarios; mechanics not defined
- **Normative Constraint** — Mentioned but not taxonomized
- **Comparative Experiment** — Defined informally; needs formal criteria

---

## Implicit Assumptions

- Constraints are enforceable and observable
- Emergence can be evaluated qualitatively
- Comparisons across frameworks are meaningful under identical constraints
- Minimal systems are sufficient to surface emergence-relevant behavior

These assumptions should either be documented or explicitly challenged.

---

## Structural Stubs

- `frameworks/` — No canonical framework template yet
- `primitives/` — No inventory or schema
- `sim/` — Declared intent but no MVE specification (see MVE doc)
- `reports/` — No format or generation rules defined

---

## Recommendation

Each item above should receive at least a stub document before expanding implementation.
