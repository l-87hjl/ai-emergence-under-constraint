# Project Checklist (Draft)

**Status:** Draft
**Date:** February 1st, 2026

This checklist tracks foundational work required to stabilize definitions, structure, and documentation for the project. Items may be revised as understanding improves.

---

## Core Definitions

- [ ] Create preliminary emergence definition  
  → `docs/emergence-definition.md`
- [ ] Define non-emergence / excluded phenomena
- [ ] Define levels or degrees of emergence (even if provisional)

---

## Simulation & Evaluation Direction

- [ ] Declare `sim/` as **experimental + comparative** (draft)
- [ ] Define what **comparative** means (e.g., same constraints, different frameworks)
- [ ] Specify a **Minimum Viable Experiment (MVE)**

---

## Framework Naming & Referencing

- [ ] Define a **standardized naming schema**  
  (ID + descriptive name + human reference)
- [ ] Apply naming schema retroactively to existing frameworks (draft if incomplete)
- [ ] Add naming rules to documentation standards

---

## Foundational Docs

- [ ] Add **1-page philosophy / scope** document
- [ ] Add **one concrete (toy-level) scenario**
- [ ] Add **glossary stub**
- [ ] Audit repository for **undocumented concepts, assumptions, and stubs**

---

## Notes

- Any item that cannot yet be finalized should be explicitly labeled **Draft** with a date.
- Structural clarity takes precedence over completeness at this stage.
