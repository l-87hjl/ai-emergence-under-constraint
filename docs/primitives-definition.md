# Primitives — Preliminary Definition (Draft)

**Status:** Draft  
**Date:** February 1st, 2026

---

## Definition

A **Primitive** is an irreducible functional component used to construct frameworks and simulations in this repository.

A primitive:
- Performs a single, well-defined role
- Cannot be decomposed without changing its function
- Is reusable across multiple frameworks
- Has explicit inputs, outputs, and constraints

Primitives are structural, not narrative.

## What Primitives Are

Primitives may include:
- Memory units or buffers
- Evaluation or scoring functions
- Constraint checkers or enforcers
- State transition mechanisms
- Observation or sensing modules

---

## What Primitives Are Not

Primitives are **not**:
- Full agents or architectures
- Scenario definitions
- Cultural or metaphorical constructs
- Optimization objectives

---

## Composition Rules

- Frameworks are composed of primitives
- Primitives must not assume global system context
- Emergent behavior must arise from interactions between primitives, not from primitives alone

---

## Documentation Requirements

Each primitive must be documented with:
- Purpose
- Inputs and outputs
- Constraints
- Known failure modes (if any)

---

## Notes

This definition is provisional and may be refined as simulations are implemented.
