# Scope and Non-Goals (Draft)

**Status:** Draft  
**Date:** February 1st, 2026

## Scope

This project investigates how **explicit constraints** shape the emergence of novel behavior in artificial systems.

Primary focus:

- Minimal, interpretable systems
- Constraint-first design
- Comparability across architectures
- Conceptual clarity over performance optimization
- Documentation-first development

The project prioritizes understanding *why* behaviors arise, not merely *that* they arise.

---

## Non-Goals

This project does **not** aim to:

- Build or approximate general intelligence
- Optimize benchmark or task performance
- Anthropomorphize artificial systems
- Make claims beyond observed and documented behavior
- Replace empirical safety research with speculation

Capability maximization is explicitly out of scope.

---

## Design Philosophy

- Constraints are treated as first-class objects
- Emergence is evaluated conservatively
- Structural clarity precedes implementation
- Names and definitions are stabilized early to prevent drift

## Notes

This document defines intent and boundaries and should be consulted before introducing new frameworks, primitives, or simulations.
