# PROJECT_SPEC

## Mission
Build a comparative framework for reasoning about AI emergence under real constraints (physics, economics, institutions), without overclaiming predictive realism.

## Primary artifacts
- Taxonomy and glossary (`docs/`)
- Architecture families (`frameworks/`)
- Convergent design primitives (`primitives/`)
- Scenario checklists (`scenarios/`)
- Minimal simulation schemas (`sim/schema/`)

## Guardrails
- Prefer *comparability and clarity* over big, unvalidated simulations.
- Encode assumptions explicitly.
- Keep cultural references in `references/` (anchors, not proofs).
