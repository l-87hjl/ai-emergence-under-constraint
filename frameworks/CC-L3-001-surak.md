# CC-L3-001 — Surak

**Descriptive Name:** Logic-Primacy Constraint Agent  
**Reference:** Surak (Vulcan philosopher, Star Trek canon)  
**Status:** Draft

## Classification

- **Level:** L3 — Agent / Architecture
- **Type:** Constraint-first cognitive architecture

---

## Core Idea

Surak is an agent architecture that prioritizes **logical coherence and normative constraint compliance** over reward maximization or heuristic optimization.

Behavior emerges from strict adherence to internal consistency rules rather than external incentives.

---

## Constraints

- Actions must satisfy explicit logical and normative constraints
- Incoherent internal state transitions are disallowed
- Memory usage is bounded and audited

---

## Intended Use

- Comparative experiments under identical constraints
- Exploration of emergence under logic-primacy assumptions

---

## Notes

This framework serves as the canonical first application of the naming schema.
