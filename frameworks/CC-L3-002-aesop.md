# CC-L3-002 — Aesop

**Descriptive Name:** Heuristic-Adaptive Constraint Agent  
**Reference:** Aesop (attributed fabulist; heuristic moral reasoning)  
**Status:** Draft  
**Date:** February 1st, 2026

---

## Classification

- **Level:** L3 — Agent / Architecture
- **Type:** Heuristic-first, constraint-bounded architecture

---

## Core Idea

Aesop contrasts with Surak by prioritizing **heuristic adaptation and pattern-based reasoning** over strict logical coherence.

Constraints are treated as soft boundaries to be negotiated rather than absolute rules to be preserved.

---

## Constraints

- Normative constraints may be violated at increasing cost
- Internal state coherence is approximate, not enforced
- Memory is bounded but reorganized opportunistically

---

## Primitives Used

- Heuristic evaluator
- Adaptive memory shard
- Constraint cost estimator

---

## Intended Use

- Comparative evaluation against CC-L3-001 (Surak)
- Exploration of emergence under flexible constraint interpretation

---

## Expected Failure Modes

- Drift toward incoherent internal state
- Constraint gaming or exploitation
- Reduced interpretability

---

## Notes

Aesop is designed as a deliberate foil to Surak, highlighting trade-offs between coherence and adaptability.
