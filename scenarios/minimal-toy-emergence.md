# Minimal Toy Emergence Scenario (Draft)

**Status:** Draft  
**Date:** February 1st, 2026

---

## Objective

To evaluate whether minimal constrained agents exhibit behaviors that meet the project’s preliminary definition of emergence.

---

## Setup

- Single agent
- Fixed evaluation loop
- Bounded memory
- Explicit normative constraint on action selection

No learning objective beyond survival or rule satisfaction is imposed.

---

## Constraints

- Memory capacity is strictly limited
- Actions violating norms are penalized or disallowed
- No external reward shaping beyond constraint enforcement

---

## Evaluation Criteria

Behavior is assessed using the following checklist:

- Novel internal state representations
- Strategy reuse across contexts
- Evidence of abstraction or compression
- Stability of behavior over time

---

## Comparative Use

This scenario may be run across multiple frameworks using identical constraints to observe qualitative differences in behavior.

---

## Notes

This scenario is intentionally minimal and serves as a grounding reference for future experiments.
