# AI Emergence Under Constraint

A structured, folders-first repository for comparing AI emergence narratives, architectures, cross-cutting primitives, and minimal world-constraint models.

## Repo map
- `docs/` — taxonomy, glossary, and explainer docs
- `frameworks/` — named architecture families (e.g., Surak, Sable, Mesh)
- `primitives/` — reusable components (e.g., shards, evaluator–generator loops)
- `scenarios/` — risk narratives and checklist-able scenario definitions
- `references/` — cultural anchors and analogies (non-structural)
- `sim/` — minimal simulation schemas and (later) toy implementations
- `reports/` — generated run/checklist outputs

## Workflow
1. Keep structure and meaning in markdown.
2. Iterate by **module**; prefer **diffs** for updates.
3. Treat visuals as generated artifacts (optional), not the source of truth.
